## Features

- Face Detection and Recognition
- Batch Image Processing

# ToDo

- Add ability to learn overtime
  - Add capability to learn from more detected faces using a small margin crop and add to name_dtb dir
- Add capability to learn new faces - Can use whispers algorithm to group these faces without needing names. Name will be UNKNOWN_(5DIGIT#). Need to make sure there are no repeats
